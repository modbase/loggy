Laravel monitor
===============

Monitors PHP errors, warnings, notices and exceptions.
These will be displayed on a dedicated webpage.

Display counter for each error type (and maybe for multiple site).

Errors | Exceptions | Warnings | Notices

When clicking on error -> panel (bottom or side?) opens with latest errors in detail

Webpage should be updated in realtime (node.js socket.io).
Or just uses database and end user must refresh manually (or javascript timeout refresh option).

First load: fetch from DB
Thereafter: get updates via socket.io events


monitor.modbase.be/update --> adds error to database (JSON API) and forwards to node.js server
